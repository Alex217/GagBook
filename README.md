GagBook is an unofficial Sailfish OS app for the [9GAG.com](https://9gag.com) website.

## Features

- Simple, smooth and native Sailfish Silica UI
- View posts in different sections, e.g. Hot, Trending, Fresh, etc.
- Account login (with email only) and voting support
- View comments of each post
- Save image and video files

## Development

This is a fork of the original GagBook app initially developed by [@dicksonleong](https://github.com/dicksonleong/GagBook) and later maintained by [@llelectronics](https://github.com/llelectronics/GagBook).

Initially GagBook used webscraping using QtWebKitWidgets to get its data. I started to work on GagBook back in December 2017 after the app was not working anymore due to a changed website, that was JS rendered since then.
Now GagBook gets its data from the undisclosed official 9GAG.com API.

I will update GagBook to fix bugs and implement new features.
