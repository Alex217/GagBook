    \class GagRequest
    \since 0.9.0
    \brief The GagRequest class handles all network requests to download the required data.

    GagRequest handles all network requests to download the required data (e.g. a list of gags).
    This is an abstract class that encapsulates a request to download the data.
    This can be a subclass to support different ways of getting gags.
